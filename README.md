## Neverland

Yet another wordpress theme  for [ikde.org](http://ikde.org).

![](http://ikde.org/wp-content/themes/neverland/screenshot.png)

It's @csslayer who forked kde-breathe from wordpress default theme: twentyten. I forked it again to make it elegant looking and functional, matching the new kde official theme: Neverland.

I removed a lot of unneeded functions, added codes respect Chinese users tastes(eg: they do not use categories and tags that much) and useful and better looking widgets.

### Now it support:

* Native thread comment

* Recent comments with [Gravatar](http://gravatar.com)

* Elegant bar monthly archive and tag cloud

* Builtin image auto resize and lightbox preview

* Syntax highlight

* Galley

* KDE commit summary auto style

* Retina Display

* Mobile friendly

### And it will support:

* Image magnifier

* Bug tracker style

* Reader wall

* Annoucement board

* Ajax post/comment/image load

* Oxygen Fonts are released under the SIL Open Font License (OFL) version 1.1 and the Gnu General Public License (with font exception) (GPL+FE).
